⬤ For Assignment 1 we were meant to create a simulation of the game "Will Skippy Get Home?".
⬤ My attempt at this simulation works perfectly for any dimension of the grid.
⬤ The user needs to input the dimension of the grid and this is followed by the console showing the user each move Skippy makes.
⬤ The console can point out if Skippy's next move will make an 'out-of-bounds' move, and let's the user know when 
   Skippy reaches his destination.
⬤ Once the program finishes running, the statistics of the simulation show
     1) the number of hops Skippy makes
     2) total number of throws the die made
     3) total number of times each side of the die (north, east, south, west) occured
