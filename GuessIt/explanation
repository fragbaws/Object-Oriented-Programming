The GuessIt game works as follows. An oracle chooses a secret integer number
randomly in some range (say 1..100). The role of the player is then to try to guess
what the number is. When a player makes a guess, the oracle responds by
informing the player if they are correct or not. If they are not correct, the game
continues, otherwise it ends
